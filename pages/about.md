## About Early American Prison Writing

The Early American Prison Writing Archive is a curated database of stories of confinement in British colonial America (1585-1800). The topics and stories were selected and curated by Davidson students in the Fall 2025 seminar ENG 445: "Prisons: Literature, Archives, Theory."
